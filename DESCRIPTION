Description: Implements various estimators of entropy for discrete random 
  variables, including the shrinkage estimator by Hausser and Strimmer (2009),
  the maximum likelihood and the Millow-Madow estimator, various Bayesian
  estimators, and the Chao-Shen estimator.  It also offers an R interface to the
  NSB estimator.  Furthermore, the package provides functions for estimating the
  Kullback-Leibler divergence, the chi-squared divergence, mutual information,
  and the chi-squared divergence of independence.  It also computes the
  G statistic and the chi-squared statistic and corresponding p-values.
  Furthermore, there are functions for discretizing continuous random variables.
