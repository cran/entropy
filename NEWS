               ========================================


             CHANGES IN `entropy' PACKAGE VERSION 1.1.2

* verbose messages for shrinkage entropy are now more informative and 
  in the same style as those from corpcor
* man pages slightly updated


              CHANGES IN `entropy' PACKAGE VERSION 1.1.1

* bug fix: freqs.shrink() now also works for sample sizes 1 and 0
* freqs.shrink(), entropy.shrink() and mi.shrink() now return the
  estimated shrinkage intensity as attribute (lambda.freqs).


              CHANGES IN `entropy' PACKAGE VERSION 1.1.0

* several new functions added for estimating mutual information:
  mi.plugin(), mi.empirical(), mi.Dirichlet() and mi.shrink().


              CHANGES IN `entropy' PACKAGE VERSION 1.0.0


This package implements the following estimators of entropy:

* the James-Stein shrinkage estimator by Hausser and Strimmer,
* the maximum likelihood estimator,
* the Miller-Madow estimator,
* various Bayesian estimators (based on Dirichlet-multinomial model),
* and the Chen-Shao estimator.

It also provides an R interface to the
*  Nemenman-Shafee-Bialek (NSB) estimator.

This is the first public release (2 September 2008).
